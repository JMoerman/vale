Vale (Verified Assembly Language for Everest)
=============================================

This directory contains Vale code, i.e., formally verified high-performance
assembly language code, with an emphasis on cryptographic code.  It relies
on the [Vale tool](https://github.com/project-everest/vale) to produce
code and proofs in [F\*](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar).

The code currently targets x64, but it will be expanded to support
other hardware platforms, such as x86 and ARM.  Our toolchain
produces assembly for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Vale is part of the [Everest project](https://project-everest.github.io).

# Installation

See the [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md) file for installing Vale and its dependencies.

# Code Organization

See the [CODE](./CODE.md) file for more details on the various files in this directory.

# Documentation

See the [documentation](./doc/compilation.txt) for commands necessary to extract the assembly langugae.
